                        <p>Turtles have existed for over 200 million years, making them among the oldest living reptile groups. Their hard shells protect them from predators and harsh environments, allowing them to thrive in diverse habitats from ocean depths to deserts.</p>
                        <p>This guide explores the biology, conservation status, and fascinating behaviors of turtles, including sea turtles, freshwater turtles, and tortoises.</p>

                        <h3>Ancient Lineage</h3>
                        <p>Turtles first appeared in the Triassic period (about 220 million years ago) and have remained relatively unchanged in their basic body structure.</p>
                    </div>
                    <div class="fact-card">
                        <h3>Shell Composition</h3>
                        <p>The shell is made up of bones fused to the ribs and vertebrae, covered by keratinous scutes. This structure provides both protection and buoyancy.</p>
                    </div>
                    <div class="fact-card">
                        <h3>Breathing</h3>
                        <p>Unlike snakes, turtles cannot breathe through their skin. They must surface to breathe air through their lungs.</p>

                        <h3>Lifespan</h3>
                        <p>Some species, like the Galápagos tortoise, can live over 100 years, while others like the common snapping turtle may live 30-50 years.</p>

                            <p>Sea turtles inhabit the world's oceans, nesting on beaches. There are seven species, including the green sea turtle, loggerhead, and leatherback.</p>

                                <li>All sea turtles are marine reptiles that spend most of their lives in the ocean.</li>
                                <li>They migrate thousands of miles between feeding grounds and nesting beaches.</li>
                                <li>Sea turtles are endangered or threatened due to habitat loss, pollution, and climate change.</li>

                                <li>They have thick, dome-shaped shells to protect against predators and harsh conditions.</li>
                                <li>Many tortoise species are threatened by habitat loss and illegal pet trade.</li>
