                        <p>Turtles are fascinating reptiles that have existed for over 200 million years, making them some of the oldest living species on Earth. They belong to the order Testudines, which includes both turtles and tortoises. While turtles are typically associated with aquatic environments, tortoises are primarily land-dwelling.</p>

                                <h3>Types of Turtles</h3>
                                <p>Turtles can be broadly categorized into three main types:</p>
                                <ul>
                                    <li><strong>Sea Turtles:</strong> These are fully aquatic and live in oceans. They are known for their streamlined bodies, flippers, and powerful swimming abilities.</li>
                                    <li><strong>Freshwater Turtles:</strong> These inhabit rivers, lakes, and ponds. They have a more rounded shell and webbed feet adapted for swimming.</li>
                                    <li><strong>Terrestrial Turtles (Tortoises):</strong> These live on land and have a more dome-shaped shell. They are often found in deserts, grasslands, and forests.</li>
                                </ul>
                            </div>

                                <h3>Physical Characteristics</h3>
                                <p>The shell of a turtle is a unique and protective feature. It is made up of two parts: the upper shell (carapace) and the lower shell (plastron). The carapace is typically covered with bony plates called scutes, which provide protection.</p>
                                <p>Turtles have a slow metabolism and a relatively low body temperature compared to mammals. They rely on external sources of heat, such as the sun, to regulate their body temperature.</p>

                        <h3>Ancient Survivors</h3>
                        <p>Turtles have been around for more than 200 million years, making them one of the oldest living reptile groups on Earth. Fossils of early turtles date back to the Triassic period.</p>

                    <div class="fact-card">
                        <h3>Slow but Steady</h3>
                        <p>Turtles are known for their slow movement, but this doesn't mean they are inactive. Some species can swim at speeds up to 20 miles per hour (32 km/h) in short bursts.</p>
                    </div>
                    <div class="fact-card">
                        <h3>Longest Lived Reptiles</h3>
                        <p>Some turtles, particularly tortoises, can live for over 100 years, with some species reaching ages of 150 or more. The oldest known turtle, named "Tui," lived to be 190 years old.</p>
                    </div>
                    <div class="fact-card">
                        <h3>Unique Shells</h3>
                        <p>The shell of a turtle is not just a protective covering; it also helps with buoyancy in water. The shape and size of the shell vary greatly among species, adapting to their specific habitats and lifestyles.</p>

                    <div class="fact-card">
                        <h3>Migratory Marvels</h3>
                        <p>Sea turtles are known for their incredible migratory abilities. They can travel thousands of miles between nesting beaches and feeding grounds. For example, the green sea turtle may travel up to 1,000 miles (1,600 km) from its nesting site to its feeding grounds.</p>
                    </div>
                    <div class="fact-card">
                        <h3>Carnivorous and Herbivorous</h3>
                        <p>Turtles have varied diets. Sea turtles are primarily carnivorous, feeding on jellyfish, crabs, and fish. Freshwater turtles and tortoises can be omnivorous, eating both plants and animals, while some species are herbivorous, consuming only vegetation.</p>

                    <p>Sea turtles inhabit the open ocean and coastal areas. They are adapted to life in water with streamlined bodies, flippers for swimming, and a unique shell shape that helps with buoyancy. Common sea turtle species include the green sea turtle, loggerhead sea turtle, and leatherback sea turtle.</p>
                    <p>These turtles are known for their long migrations, often traveling thousands of miles between nesting beaches and feeding grounds. They play a crucial role in maintaining the health of marine ecosystems by controlling populations of certain species and promoting plant growth through their feeding habits.</p>

                <div id="freshwater-tab" class="tab-content">
                    <p>Freshwater turtles are found in rivers, lakes, and ponds around the world. They have a more rounded shell compared to sea turtles and webbed feet adapted for swimming. Some freshwater turtles, like the red-eared slider, are popular pets due to their hardiness and adaptability.</p>
                    <p>These turtles feed on a variety of foods, including insects, fish, plants, and small animals. They play an important role in their ecosystems by controlling populations of certain species and promoting plant growth through their feeding habits.</p>

                <div id="terrestrial-tab" class="tab-content">
                    <p>Terrestrial turtles, commonly known as tortoises, live on land and are often found in deserts, grasslands, and forests. They have a more dome-shaped shell that provides protection from predators and the elements. Tortoises are primarily herbivorous, feeding on plants, fruits, and vegetables.</p>
                    <p>Some species of tortoises are known for their long lifespans, with some living over 100 years. They are also known for their slow movement, which helps them conserve energy and avoid predators.</p>
